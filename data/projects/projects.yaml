  description:
    - "Created a vision transformer (ViT) using JAX and Equinox based off the original ViT paper, 'An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Recognition at Scale' (arXiv:2010.11929). This was made as part of my group's final project in CS 182 (Deep Neural Networks) at UC Berkeley in the fall 2022 semester."
    - "The goal of the project was to create a homework assignment that can be used in future renditions of the class. This notebook contains the coding component of our homework assignment, which explained the intricacies of vision transformers to students. I wrote most of the code and explanations for our group. Linked below is the solution notebook, which contains a completed LeNet-5 and ViT implementation using JAX and Equinox, a library that brings PyTorch-like neural nets to JAX."
    - "The notebook linked is slightly modified from the original submission. It does not include the 'todo' questions contained in the original notebook."
