  description: "Like many exotic cars, the 2022 McLaren 720S offers a lot of show and serious go. The thrills include explosive launches and the kind of ethereal agility that'll send serious drivers into ecstasy. At the heart of McLaren's lightweight, carbon-fiber-intensive dream machine is a 710-hp twin-turbo V-8. While the engine has considerable turbo lag, the short pause after you stomp the accelerator allows a beat to prepare for a rush to 100 mph in just 5.2 seconds and the ability to reach a claimed 212 mph."
